### Hello there! :wave:

I am Susheel (@divergent96). I am a experienced data analyst with demonstrated history of working in data analytics consulting. I have led various analyses focusing on customer targeting and segmentation, patient level data analytics, sales data analytics and performance reporting. I am skilled in using Python, R, SAS, SQL and Excel to analyse large datasets and present actionable insights to clients using Powerpoint or custom Excel dashboards.   

I am a current Masters student at Trent University, pursuing a Masters in Science in Big Data analytics. Through this program, I aim to build upon my existing skillset and expand my knowledge of available tools for data analytics.

I am passionate about working on unstructured data to identify interesting insights, and automating manual workflows to help focus on gathering insights from clean data. I actively identify opportunities to find creative ways to analyse large data and further improve my data science skills.

Please feel free to reach out for a chat on anything data science or even games/computers!
