Hi, I’m Susheel (@divergent96). I have been working n Analytics since last 3.5 years, and I expect to graduate with Masters in Big Data analytics in 2023.

I am currently focused on learning Data engineering and using Machine learning to discover and answer business questions. 

Feel free to ping me on discord (Susheel#8777) for anything.
