Hi, I’m Susheel (@divergent96). I did my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and moved to a Business ops./Data analyst role post graduation.

After using lot of data and design methodologies to construct an offroad vehicle, I got interested in analysis and representation of data.
I am currently focused on learning Data engineering and using advanced models to understand data and derive insights. 

Feel free to ping me on discord (Susheel#8777) for anything.
